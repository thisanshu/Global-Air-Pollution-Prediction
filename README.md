# Global-Air-Pollution-Prediction
Air pollution is a critical global public health issue, contributing to millions of premature deaths each year. Understanding how pollution levels vary over time and space is essential for issuing health alerts, guiding urban planning, and mitigating environmental risks.

This project explores air quality data through thorough preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis. It aims to uncover trends and patterns in pollutant levels and build predictive models for future air pollution measurements.

Key Features:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of pollutant trends over time

Handling missing data and outliers for cleaner insights

Visualizations to highlight seasonal and geographical pollution patterns

Baseline predictive modeling for air quality forecasting

Final inference summarizing data-driven observations
